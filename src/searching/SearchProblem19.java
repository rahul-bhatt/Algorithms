 * Problem: MAJORITY FIND
 * ***********************
 * 
 * Several applications require identification of tokens - objects which implement an equals method - in a sequence which appear more than a
 * specified fraction of the total number of tokens. For example, we may want to identify the users using the largest fraction of the network 
 * or IP addresses originating the most HTTP requests. Here we consider a simplified version of this problem.
 * 
 * You are reading a sequence of words from a very long stream. You know a priori that more than half the words are repetitions of a single 
 * word w (the majority element) but the positions where w occurs are unknown. Design an algorithm that makes a single pass over the stream 
 * and uses only a constant amount of memory to identify w.
