 * Problem: 2D ARRAY SEARCH
 * *************************
 * 
 * Let A be an n Ã— n 2D array where rows and columns are sorted in increasing sorted order. 
 * Design an efficient algorithm that decides whether a number x appears in A.
 * How many entries of A does your algorithm inspect in the worst case?
 * Can you prove a tight lower bound that any such algorithm has to consider in the worst case?
 * 
 * Solution:
