 * Problem: THE k'th LARGEST ELEMENT - LARGE n AND SMALL k
 * *******************************************************
 * 
 * Design an algorithm for computing the k-th largest element in a sequence (stream) of elements. It should run in O(n) expected time where 
 * n is the length of the sequence, which is not known in advance. The value k is known in advance. It should use O(k) additional storage.
